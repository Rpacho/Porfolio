                    The way I manage the team is first to find what do we need to finish the game. After talking about our ideas and coming up in consensus,
                    I created game design document to identify our needs and made tickets from the project board. This way, it is easy to keep track in what everyone is working on.
                    I assign everyone on their task, and everytime there is a problem come up, I tried to talk about it with everyone's opinion
